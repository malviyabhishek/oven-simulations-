This is one of the EMBEDDED Internship Project done during the Intership at EMERTXE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PVT LTD..

## INTRODUCTION
A microwave oven or simply microwave is an electric oven that heats and
cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave
frequency range.The intelligence of the machine was based on PIC16F877A microcontroller. This provides the sequence of instructions that controls the machine from start to finish according to the cooking mode selected. A microwave oven is  designed to cook in diffrent modes Micro Mode,Grill Mode,Convection Mode,Start Mode for differnt types of cooking styles

## Installation
[MPLAB XIDE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6Rmj98yI7_Y5H--lwe8m4DN3FVB0o-k4u7y-e0-T-w_9Cct4qIL2pq20aAkIFEALw_wcB#tabs)

## Steps to Run Project

To run this project

1.Download the code this zip file

2.Extract the files

3.open mplabXide >open project>Select the path of extracted file>select open project.

4.Once the project file opens,right click select batch build to build project.

5.After the code is Build Succesfully observe the file dictionary of hex file genarated.

6.Now,go for Picsimlab choose >Board -picgenosis ,Microcontroller-Pic16F877A.

7.And now go for file select the path for hexfile load the hexfile

8.Pressing the defined switches we could see the display for differnt microwave program program
